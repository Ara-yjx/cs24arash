// CLASS PROVIDED:
//   class polynomial (in the namespace main_savitch_3)
//     A polynomial has one variable x, real number coefficients, and
//     non-negative integer exponents. Such a polynomial can be viewed
//     as having the form:
//       A[n]*x^n + A[n-1]*x^(n-1) + ... A[2]*x^2 + A[1]*x + A[0]
//     where the A[n] are the real number coefficients and x^i represents
//     the variable x raised to the i power. The coefficient A[0] is
//     called the "constant" or "zeroth" term of the polynomial.
//   
// NOTES TO STUDENT:
//   1. This version works by storing the coefficients in
//      a fixed array. The coefficient for the x^k term is stored
//      in location [k] of the fixed-size array. Later we will modify
//      the implementation to use a dynamic array.
//   2. Note that two functions have been implemented as inline functions
//      in this file (the degree and operator() functions).
//
// MEMBER CONSTANTS
//   const static size_t CAPACITY
//     The size of the fixed array to store the coefficients.
//   const static size_t MAX_EX = CAPACITY - 1;
//     The maximum exponent permitted.
//
// CONSTRUCTOR for the polynomial class
//   polynomial(double c = 0.0, unsigned int exponent = 0)
//     PRECONDITION: exponent <= MAX_EX.
//     POSTCONDITION: This polynomial has been create with all zero
//     coefficients, except for coefficient c for the specified exponent.
//     When used as a default constructor (using default values for
//     both arguments), the result is a polynomial with all zero
//     coefficients.
//
// MODIFICATION MEMBER FUNCTIONS for the polynomial class
//   void add_to_coef(double amount, unsigned int exponent)
//     PRECONDITION: exponent <= MAX_EX.
//     POSTCONDITION: Adds the given amount to the coefficient of the
//     specified exponent.
//
//   void assign_coef(double coefficient, unsigned int exponent)
//     PRECONDITION: exponent <= MAX_EX.
//     POSTCONDITION: Sets the coefficient for the specified exponent.
//
//   void clear( )
//     POSTCONDITION: All coefficients of this polynomial are set to zero.
//
// CONSTANT MEMBER FUNCTIONS for the polynomial class
//   double coefficient(unsigned int exponent) const
//     POSTCONDITION: Returns coefficient at specified exponent of this
//     polynomial.
//     NOTE: for exponents > MAX_EX, the return value is always zero.
//
//   unsigned int degree( ) const
//     POSTCONDITION: The function returns the value of the largest exponent
//     with a non-zero coefficient.
//     If all coefficients are zero, then the function returns zero.
//
//   polynomial derivative( ) const
//     POSTCONDITION: The return value is the first derivative of this 
//     polynomial.
//
//   double eval(double x) const
//     POSTCONDITION: The return value is the value of this polynomial with the
//     given value for the variable x.
//
//   unsigned int next_term(unsigned int e) const
//     POSTCONDITION: The return value is the next exponent n which is LARGER
//     than e such that coefficient(n) != 0.
//     If there is no such term, then the return value is zero.
//
//   unsigned int previous_term(unsigned int e) const
//     POSTCONDITION: The return value is the next exponent n which is SMALLER
//     than e such that coefficient(n) != 0.
//     If there is no such term, then the return value is UINT_MAX
//     from <climits>.
//
// CONSTANT OPERATORS for the polynomial class
//   double operator( ) (double x) const
//     Same as the eval member function.
//
// NON-MEMBER BINARY OPERATORS for the polynomial Class
//   polynomial operator -(const polynomial& p1, const polynomial& p2)
//     POSTCONDITION: return-value is a polynomial with each coefficient
//     equal to the difference of the coefficients of p1 & p2 for any given
//     exponent.
//
//   polynomial operator +(const polynomial& p1, const polynomial& p2)
//     POSTCONDITION: return-value is a polynomial with each coefficient
//     equal to the sum of the coefficients of p1 & p2 for any given
//     exponent.
//
//   polynomial operator *(const polynomial& p1, const polynomial& p2)
//     PRECONDITION: p1.degree( ) + p2.degree( ) <= polynomial::MAX_EX.
//     POSTCONDITION: Each term of p1 has been multiplied by each term of p2,
//     and the answer is the sum of all these term-by-term products.
//     For example, if p1 is 2x^2 + 3x + 4 and p2 is 5x^2 - 1x + 7, then the
//     return value is 10x^4 + 13x^3 + 31x^2 + 17x + 28.
//
// NON-MEMBER OUTPUT FUNCTION for the polynomial Class
//   ostream& operator << (ostream& out, const polynomial& p)
//     POSTCONDITION: The polynomial has been printed to ostream out, which,
//     in turn, has been returned to the calling function.
//     [CS 24 Note - std::endl is printed following the polynomial]
